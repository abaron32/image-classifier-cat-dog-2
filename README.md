## Image classifier project

In this project we train a neural network to classify if an image is a dog or a cat.

Before training the model we reshape the images (taken from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54765) so the size is 200*200. This is done in the notebook DogCatResize.ipynb.

Then, we train the neural network using Tensorflow in the notebook Cat_Dog_Model.ipynb.
